# Recoverability-in-AWS
In this project, a multi-availability zone, multi-region databases and a versioned website were created. It have been demonstrated how applications can use this distributed infrastructure and migrate a primary database from one geographical region to another and how it is protected from accidental or malicious disruption, with an ability to turn-back-the-clock when something disrupts your normal operations.
